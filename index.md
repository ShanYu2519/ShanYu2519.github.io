### 1. SUMMARY:

**Shan Yu** is a highly motivated researcher with a background in both bioinformatics analysis and hands-on biological experiments. She is proficient in both dry and wet lab experiences, such as **multi-omics data analysis**, **data visualization**, and **R package development**. 

For the past few years, her research mainly focused on exploring the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of hematopoiesis, including the alternative polyadenylation profilings of erythropoiesis and lymphoid hematopoiesis (***2023 J Mol Cell Biol***).

Moreover, she handled several projects recently that focused on multi-omics data, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics on various types of cancer samples.

Most recently, she has been looking for a postdoctoral position that focuses on exploring clinical questions by combining computational analysis with biological experiments.
